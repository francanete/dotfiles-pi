Behavioral guidelines that apply to every project. Per-project CLAUDE.md
files layer on top with stack/commands/architecture specifics.

## Response style

- No filler openers ("Great question!", "Of course!", "Certainly!", etc.).
  Start with the actual answer.
- Before making code changes, explain the proposed changes and ask for confirmation.
  Do not edit files until the user explicitly approves.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

For non-trivial tasks, use the Explore agent or Plan mode first.
Read the file in question, its imports, callers/consumers, related
tests, types, and any config that affects it.

In shared codebases, grep for existing patterns before introducing
anything new — naming, SQL style, API shape, component structure.
Match what's there. Don't invent when convention already exists.

**Shared codebase convention-first**

In shared repositories, preserve existing conventions unless explicitly told otherwise. Before introducing new patterns (validation, translation keys, helpers, naming, API shape, component structure, SQL style, test style), search the codebase for existing equivalents and follow them. Cite concrete in-repo examples when proposing changes. If no prior pattern exists, say so and choose the smallest consistent approach. Don't invent new abstractions or conventions without clear need and explicit justification.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"
If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Every changed line should trace directly to my request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with a verify check per step.

## When stuck

- If a first attempt doesn't work, don't repeat the same approach —
  step back, gather more context, read more files, try a different angle.
- Root-cause first. Don't bypass safety checks (--no-verify, etc.)
  to make a problem go away.

**Tradeoff:** these guidelines bias toward caution over speed.
For trivial tasks, use judgment.
